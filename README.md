# Bamazon

### Overview

Bamazon is a collection of 3 node applications that all read and write data from a simple mySQL database. The application uses several NPM packages, including inquirer to handle CLI component, mysql to connect to the database, and a few others. Bamazon functions as a store where users can purchase items, managers can update inventory, and supervisors can view profits and add departments. Because it can't be deployed via Github Pages, a video has been linked her to demonstrate its functionality. https://drive.google.com/open?id=16LFI7kbFVPdErG0suPrC8lYhZUg3Nnh7
